	description "This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
	An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn." {
		table {
			headers "d10" "Behavior"
			row "1" "The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn."
			row "2-6" "The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn."
			row "7-8" "The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn."
			row "9-10" "The creature can act and move normally."
		}

	description "At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target."
	description (Title)"At Higher Levels" "When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th."
